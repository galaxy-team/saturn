saturn
======

An emulator for the [DCPU-16](http://www.dcpu.com) platform.

Saturn requires SFML for much of its external interaction.
In the Ubuntu default repo's for apt-get, only the 1.6 version is available.
You can add a Launchpad PPA, however, if you still wish to use apt-get.

For that, do this;

```shell
$ sudo apt-add-repository -y \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/sonkun/sfml-stable/ubuntu raring main\"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

Saturn also relies on a compiler compatible with C++11
